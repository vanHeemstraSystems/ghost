# 100 - Quick Installation

If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use our **CLI tool**:

```
$ npm install ghost-cli -g
```

Then, if installing locally add the local flag to get up and running in under a minute - [Local install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/):

```
$ ghost install local
```

or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - [Production install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/):

```
$ ghost install
```

Check out our [official documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/) for more information about our [recommended hosting stack](https://ghost.org/docs/hosting/) & properly [upgrading Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/update/), plus everything you need to develop your own Ghost [themes](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/) or work with our [API](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/).
